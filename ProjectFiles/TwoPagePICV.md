XX: Is the participant providing research input on this project?
----------------------------------------------------------------

For a PI

If the participant answers 'No', they will be asked to upload a 2 page
CV to support the PI's involvement in the proposed project.

The 2 page CV must be relevant to the application and can include
significant career interruptions. It is up to the participant to
determine the appropriate information to include in the CV.

NOTE: do not include links to external information that is material to the CV - doi/s are OK, but not webpages that expand on the information in the CV.
