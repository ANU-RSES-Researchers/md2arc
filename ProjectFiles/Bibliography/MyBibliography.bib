  abstract = {It is generally agreed that the Last Interglacial (LIG; {$\sim$}130\textendash 115 ka) was a time when global average temperatures and global mean sea level were higher than they are today. However, the exact timing, magnitude and spatial pattern of ice melt is much debated. One difficulty in extracting past global mean sea level from local observations is that their elevations need to be corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), which requires knowledge of Earth's internal viscoelastic structure. While this structure is generally assumed to be radially symmetric, evidence from seismology, geodynamics and mineral physics indicates that large lateral variations in viscosity exist within the mantle. In this study, we construct a new model of Earth's internal structure by converting shear wave speed into viscosity using parametrizations from mineral physics experiments and geodynamic constraints on Earth's thermal structure. We use this 3-D Earth structure, which includes both variations in lithospheric thickness and lateral variations in viscosity, to calculate the first 3-D GIA prediction for LIG sea level. We find that the difference between predictions with and without lateral Earth structure can be metres to 10s of metres in the near field of former ice sheets, and up to a few metres in their far field. We demonstrate how forebulge dynamics and continental levering are affected by laterally varying Earth structure, with a particular focus on those sites with prominent LIG sea level records. Results from four 3-D GIA calculations show that accounting for lateral structure can act to increase local sea level by up to {$\sim$}1.5 m at the Seychelles and minimally decrease it in Western Australia. We acknowledge that this result is only based on a few simulations, but if robust, this shift brings estimates of global mean sea level from these two sites into closer agreement with each other. We further demonstrate that simulations with a suitable radial viscosity profile can be used to locally approximate the 3-D GIA result, but that these radial profiles cannot be found by simply averaging viscosity below the sea level indicator site.},

The viscoelastic response of the solid Earth is controlled by its viscosity structure. Therefore, the appropriate choice of Earth structure for GIA models is still an important area of research in geodynamics. We construct 18 3D Earth structures that are derived from seismic tomography models and are geodynamically constrained. We consider uncertainties in 3D viscosity structures that arise from variations in the conversion from seismic velocity to temperature variations (factor r) and radial viscosity profiles (RVP). We apply these Earth models to a 3D GIA model, VILMA, to investigate the influence of such structure on RSL predictions. The variabilities in 3D Earth structures and RSL predictions are investigated for globally distributed sites and applied for comparisons with regional 1D models for ice center (North America, Antarctica) and peripheral regions (Central Oregon Coast, San Jorge Gulf).},

  abstract = {Tectonic displacement contaminates estimates of peak eustatic sea level (and, equivalently, minimum continental ice volumes) determined from the elevation of Quaternary interglacial highstand markers. For sites at which a stratigraphic or geomorphic marker of peak Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e sea level exists, the standard approach for estimating local tectonic uplift (or subsidence) rates takes the difference between the elevation of the local highstand marker and a reference MIS 5e eustatic value, commonly chosen as \th 6 m, and divides by the age of the marker. The resulting rate is then applied to correct the elevation of all other local observed sea-level markers for tectonic displacement, including peak highstands of different ages (e.g., MIS 5a, MIS 5c and MIS 11), under the assumption that the tectonic rate remained constant over those periods. This approach introduces two potentially significant errors. First, the peak eustatic value adopted for MIS 5e in most previous studies (i.e., \th 6 m) is likely incorrect. Second, local peak sea level during MIS 5e is characterized by significant departures from eustasy due to glacial isostatic adjustment in response to both successive glacialeinterglacial cycles and excess polar ice-sheet melt relative to present day values. We use numerical models of glacial isostatic adjustment that incorporate both of these effects to quantify the plausible range of the combined error and show that, even at sites far from melting ice sheets, local peak sea level during MIS 5e may depart from eustasy by 2e4 m, or more. We also demonstrate that the associated error in the estimated tectonic rates can significantly alter previous estimates of peak eustatic sea level during Quaternary highstands, notably those associated with earlier interglacials (e.g., MIS 11).},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             We present a 2-D thermomechanical computational framework for simulating earthquake sequences in a non-linear visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. The method is developed for a plane-strain problem and incorporates an invariant formulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction law and an adaptive time-stepping, which allows the time step to vary by many orders of magnitude during a simulation. Long-term tectonic convergence is imposed by displacing a boundary at a constant rate, whereas temperature-dependent viscosity is solved using a rapidly converging Newton\textendash Raphson scheme. The 2-D volume is discretized using finite differences on a fully staggered grid and marker-in-cell techniques. An adaptive free-surface approximation is used to modulate the air viscosity with the time step, which allows stresses to vanish on the free surface during the propagation of fast slipping events. We present a set of increasingly complex models in which we investigate how inertia, radiation damping, thermally activated non-linear rheology and off-megathrust splay-fault events affect sequences of seismic and aseismic slip on a simplified subduction megathrust. The new method provides a unique computational framework to analyse earthquake sequences and to connect forearc deformation with the dynamic properties of the megathrust, thus providing a physical link between observations spanning from slow interseismic strain accumulation to localized coseismic slip of individual earthquakes and post-seismic viscoelastic relaxation.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations of sequences of earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS) have made great progress over past decades to address important questions in earthquake physics. However, significant challenges in SEAS modeling remain in resolving multiscale interactions between earthquake nucleation, dynamic rupture, and aseismic slip, and understanding physical factors controlling observables such as seismicity and ground deformation. The increasing complexity of SEAS modeling calls for extensive efforts to verify codes and advance these simulations with rigor, reproducibility, and broadened impact. In 2018, we initiated a community code-verification exercise for SEAS simulations, supported by the Southern California Earthquake Center. Here, we report the findings from our first two benchmark problems (BP1 and BP2), designed to verify different computational methods in solving a mathematically well-defined, basic faulting problem. We consider a 2D antiplane problem, with a 1D planar vertical strike-slip fault obeying rate-and-state friction, embedded in a 2D homogeneous, linear elastic halfspace. Sequences of quasi-dynamic earthquakes with periodic occurrences (BP1) or bimodal sizes (BP2) and their interactions with aseismic slip are simulated. The comparison of results from 11 groups using different numerical methods show excellent agreements in long-term and coseismic fault behavior. In BP1, we found that truncated domain boundaries influence interseismic stressing, earthquake recurrence, and coseismic rupture, and that model agreement is only achieved with sufficiently large domain sizes. In BP2, we found that complexity of fault behavior depends on how well physical length scales related to spontaneous nucleation and rupture propagation are resolved. Poor numerical resolution can result in artificial complexity, impacting simulation results that are of potential interest for characterizing seismic hazard such as earthquake size distributions, moment release, and recurrence times. These results inform the development of more advanced SEAS models, contributing to our further understanding of earthquake system dynamics.},

The effects of centre of mass motion, polar wander feedback, and selfconsistent ocean loading are implemented. To assess the model's accuracy, we benchmark the numerical results against a semi-analytic solution for spherically symmetric structure. We force our model with the ICE-5G global ice loading history to study the effects of laterally varying viscosity structure on several glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) observables, including relative sea-level (RSL) measurements in Canada, and present-day time-variable gravity and uplift rates in Antarctica. Canadian RSL observations have been used to determine the Earth's globally averaged viscosity profile. Antarctic GPS uplift rates have been used to constrain Antarctic GIA models. And GIA time-variable gravity and uplift signals are error sources for GRACE and altimeter estimates of present-day Antarctic ice mass loss, and must be modelled and removed from those estimates. Computing GIA results for a 3-D viscosity profile derived from a realistic seismic tomography model, and comparing with results computed for 1-D averages of that 3-D profile, we conclude that: (1) a GIA viscosity model based on Canadian relative sea-level data is more likely to represent a Canadian average than a true global average; (2) the effects of 3-D viscosity structure on GRACE estimates of present-day Antarctic mass loss are probably smaller than the difference between GIA models based on different Antarctic deglaciation histories and (3) the effects of 3-D viscosity structure on Antarctic GPS observations of present-day uplift rate can be significant, and can complicate efforts to use GPS observations to constrain 1-D GIA models.},

We present a global compilation of active plate boundaries and geological provinces in a shapefile format with interpretive attributes (e.g., crust type, plate type, province type, last orogeny).  The initial plate and province boundaries are constructed from a combination of published global and regional models that we refine using a variety of geoscientific constraints including, but not limited to, relative GPS motions, earthquakes, mapped faults, potential field characteristics, and geochronology.  These new plate model show improved correlation to observed earthquake and volcano occurrences within deformation zones and microplates, compared to existing models, capturing 73 and 80\% of these criteria, respectively.  We estimate 57.7\% of the Earth's surface is covered by oceanic crust, which is a slight increase relative to the most recent seafloor age model. The model of last orogenies agrees well with peaks in the globally summed geochronology data. There is room for improvement in future editions of our global plate and geologic provinces model where basins, ice, or lack of geological data fidelity obscure bedrock geology, particularly in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, much of Africa, East Antarctica, and eastern Australia.  Additionally, some province types\textemdash orogens, shields, and cratons that are homogenized within our global scheme\textemdash can likely be partitioned into smaller terranes with more precise geodynamic attributes.  Despite some of these shortcomings, the digital maps presented here form a self-consistent data standard for adding spatial metadata to geoscientific databases. The database is available on GitHub where the geoscience community can provide updates to improve the models and their contemporaneity as new knowledge is acquired.  The files are also released in formats suitable for use in Generic Mapping Tools and GoogleEarth.}

The key new model component is an invariant reformulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction equations, which is designed for earthquake simulations along spontaneously evolving faults. Here we describe the methodology and demonstrate that it is accurate and stable in a setup consisting of a mature strike-slip fault zone. We show that the nucleation and propagation of an earthquake are well resolved, as supported by a good agreement with various analytical approximations, including those of the nucleation and cohesive zone lengths. Results generally converge with respect to grid size, time step, and other numerical parameters. The convergence rate with respect to grid size depends on the internodal averaging scheme, is influenced by wave reflections, and deteriorates for inclined faults. The simulated slip spectrum, ranging from stable sliding at the loading rate to periodic aseismic slip to periodic seismic slip as a function of nucleation size, is in general agreement with the literature. In this simple setup, dynamic pressure does not play a significant role. By analyzing the role of viscous deformation, we identify and confirm by our simulations a theoretical viscosity threshold below which earthquakes cannot nucleate. This threshold is shown to depend on the reference strength of rate- and state-dependent friction and the loading strain rate, which is in agreement with previous work on the brittle-ductile transition.},

We determined 6739 velocities from time series of (mostly) continuous GPS measurements; i.e., by far the largest global velocity solution to date. We transformed 15,772 velocities from 233 (mostly) published studies onto our core solution to obtain 22,511 velocities in the same reference frame. Care is taken to not use velocities from stations (or time periods) that are affected by transient phenomena; i.e., this data set consists of velocities best representing the interseismic plate velocity. About 14\% of the Earth is allowed to deform in 145,086 deforming grid cells (0.25  longitude by 0.2  latitude in dimension). The remainder of the Earth's surface is modeled as rigid spherical caps representing 50 tectonic plates. For 36 plates we present new GPS-derived angular velocities. For all the plates that can be compared with the most recent geologic plate motion model, we find that the difference in angular velocity is significant. The rigid-body rotations are used as boundary conditions in the strain rate calculations. The strain rate field is modeled using the Haines and Holt method, which uses splines to obtain an self-consistent interpolated velocity gradient tensor field, from which strain rates, vorticity rates, and expected velocities are derived. We also present expected faulting orientations in areas with significant vorticity, and update the no-net rotation reference frame associated with our global velocity gradient field.

  abstract = {The elevations and chronology of interglacial shorelines and other sea-level indicators provide information on ice volumes for these earlier periods compared with today. But, as for the Holocene, the relationship between sea levels and ice volumes for earlier interglacials is not simple because of the planet's deformational, gravitational and rotational response to changes in ice-water loads (glacio-hydro isostasy). In particular, the pattern of global sea level for a particular interglacial will be a function of the earth and ocean response to ice loads applied before, during and after the interglacial in question. This paper examines the role of glacio-hydro isostasy during these glacial cycles to make three key points. The first is to demonstrate why interglacial sea levels cannot be interpreted directly in terms of ice volume. The second is to illustrate the spatial variability that can be expected in interglacial sea levels because of the Earth's isostatic response to changing ice and water loads and to demonstrate why observations from different localities should not be combined into a single sea-level function without first correcting for differential isostatic effects. The third addresses the question whether, in the absence of perfect knowledge of the ice sheets and earth rheology, inferences can be made about ice volumes during an interglacial. We conclude that if these isostatic factors are ignored, interpretations of interglacial sea levels can lead to serious errors in the inferences about ice volumes during the interglacials.},

Rev. 21 (2002) 409) although the details of the ANU group's procedures have not been published because they are mainly computational in nature rather than representing significant conceptual advances. Because of this criticism, we set out here in detail the procedures that have been used for the treatment of the migration of shorelines as sea levels rise and fall, the effect of retreat and advancing grounded ice on shelves and shallow seas, and the transitions from grounded to floating ice (and vice versa). We conclude that there is no basis for the criticism, that these formulations and their implementation provide a high resolution and complete description of both sea-level change and of the estimates of volumes of ice exchanged with the oceans. The results from this formulation are confirmed by the entirely independent analyses of Milne et al. (Quat. Sci. Rev. 21 (2002) 361) and Mitrovica and Milne (Geophys. J. Int. (2002), submitted for publication) who conclude that our formulation is significantly more accurate than the procedure advocated by Peltier (Science 265 (1994) 195; Rev. Geophys. 36 (1998a) 603, Geophys. Res. Lett. 25 (1998b) 3955).},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section In models of crustal deformation at a scale of a few tens of kilometres, it is appropriate to use a Mohr\textendash Coulomb yield criterion for lithospheric failure based on the idea that frictional slip occurs on whichever one of many randomly oriented planes happens to be favourably oriented with respect to the stress field. The Drucker\textendash Prager yield criterion has very similar characteristics to the Mohr\textendash Coulomb criterion but is more straightforward to implement, particularly in the context of large-scale fluid-mechanical deformation of the coupled system of mantle, lithosphere and crust. As such models become more sophisticated it is important to be able to use whichever failure model is appropriate to a given part of the system. We have therefore developed a way to represent Mohr\textendash Coulomb failure within the mathematical framework used by mantle-convection fluid dynamics codes. The new formulation is based on the conceptual picture of lithospheric failure incorporated in the Anderson model of fault development and reproduces shear band angles predicted by this model. We use an transversely isotropic viscous rheology (a different viscosity for pure shear to that for simple shear) to define a preferred plane for slip to occur given the local stress field. The simple-shear viscosity and the deformation can then be iterated to ensure that the yield criterion is always satisfied. We assume the Boussinesq approximation can be applied in the model \textendash{} neglecting any effect of dilatancy on the stress field. An additional criterion is required to ensure that deformation occurs along the plane aligned with maximum shear strain rate rather than the perpendicular plane, which is formally equivalent in any symmetric formulation. We compare the behaviour of this formulation to the Drucker\textendash Prager failure model for two-dimensional (2D) layered brittle\textendash ductile systems. The pattern of shear bands is found to be quite similar from each model, although some differences are seen in the characteristic spacings for `equivalent' values of the material properties. In 3D similar patterns are seen but are modulated by additional 3D structure.},

  abstract = {Observations of isostatic adjustment of the Earth's surface due to glacial loading provide important constraints on mantle viscosity structure. We solve the forward problem of glacial isostatic adjustment in two complementary ways: a spectral method for strictly 1-D (spherically symmetric) earth models, and a finite element method that can accommodate 3-D viscosity structure. We discuss how each method may be augmented in three ways: to accommodate motion of the centre of mass, to implement a gravitationally self-consistent ocean load via the sea level equation and to include the influence of polar wander. With all these effects implemented, the two methods are benchmarked against each other. We also study the influence of lateral viscosity variations upon measurements of post-glacial rebound (PGR) in two ways: first by observing the effect of viscosity perturbations in an idealized model and second by developing a realistic 3-D viscosity model and comparing it with results of related 1-D (spherically symmetric) models. The 3-D viscosity structure is derived starting from seismic tomography models. We conclude from both approaches that PGR observations are sensitive to both the local viscosity structure and to the viscosity structure beneath the loaded region, even if it is removed from where the observations are made. In particular, PGR measurements made at Hudson Bay tend to reflect the local viscosity structure beneath Hudson Bay; PGR measurements made along the east coast of North America, being sensitive to both the local (east coast) viscosity structure as well as the loaded (continental) viscosity structure, are not reproducible with a 1-D viscosity model.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Natural fault networks are geometrically complex systems that evolve through time. The evolution of faults and their off-fault damage patterns are influenced by both dynamic earthquake ruptures and aseismic deformation in the interseismic period. To better understand each of their contributions to faulting we simulate both earthquake rupture dynamics and long-term deformation in a visco-elasto-plastic crust subjected to rate- and state-dependent friction. The continuum mechanics-based numerical model presented here includes three new features. First, a 2.5-D approximation is created to incorporate the effects of a viscoelastic lower crustal substrate below a finite depth. Second, we introduce a dynamically adaptive (slip-velocity-dependent) measure of fault width to ensure grid size convergence of fault angles for evolving faults. Third, fault localization is facilitated by plastic strain weakening of bulk rate and state friction parameters as inspired by laboratory experiments. This allows us to simulate sequences of episodic fault growth due to earthquakes and aseismic creep for the first time. Localized fault growth is simulated for four bulk rheologies ranging from persistent velocity weakening to velocity strengthening. Interestingly, in each of these bulk rheologies, faults predominantly localize and grow due to aseismic deformation. Yet, cyclic fault growth at more realistic growth rates is obtained for a bulk rheology that transitions from velocity-strengthening friction to velocity-weakening friction. Fault growth occurs under Riedel and conjugate angles and transitions towards wing cracks. Off-fault deformation, both distributed and localized, is typically formed during dynamic earthquake ruptures. Simulated off-fault deformation structures range from fan-shaped distributed deformation to localized splay faults. We observe that the fault-normal width of the outer damage zone saturates with increasing fault length due to the finite depth of the seismogenic zone. We also observe that dynamically and statically evolving stress fields from neighboring fault strands affect primary and secondary fault growth and thus that normal stress variations affect earthquake sequences. Finally, we find that the amount of off-fault deformation distinctly depends on the degree of optimality of a fault with respect to the prevailing but dynamically changing stress field. Typically, we simulate off-fault deformation on faults parallel to the loading direction. This produces a 6.5-fold higher off-fault energy dissipation than on an optimally oriented fault, which in turn has a 1.5-fold larger stress drop. The misalignment of the fault with respect to the static stress field thus facilitates off-fault deformation. These results imply that fault geometries bend, individual fault strands interact, and optimal orientations and off-fault deformation vary through space and time. With our work we establish the basis for simulations and analyses of complex evolving fault networks subject to both long-term and short-term dynamics.},

  abstract = {The rupture mechanisms of intermediate depth earthquakes have led to a view that subducting slabs often exhibit either bulk extension or shortening in the upper mantle. Additionally, bending-related deformation has been invoked to explain the distribution and orientation of seismicity in double seismic zones. However, to date there is no clear understanding of why bending is more or less prominent in different settings. The primary aim of this research is to explore the relationship between intermediate depth seismicity and subduction dynamics, utilising thermo-mechanical modelling. I show that bending, in conjunction with strong thermal restrictions, can produce diverse seismic expression. For instance, flat slab geometries induce zones of positive bending rate within sub- horizontal, low-curvature sections of the slab. This gives rise to downdip extension in the upper part the flat slab, consistent with prevalent normal faulting in flat slab settings in Mexico, Peru and Chile. Deeper earthquakes on the lower side of the bending neutral plane are much less common. Overall, this leads to an apperent state of bulk downdip stretching. These examples, along with other settings explored in this study, suggest that bending has a more prevalent role than previously recognised. Another key theme of this research is how changes in mantle wedge flow can influence slab morphology and the configuration of volcanic arcs. These insights intersect with the seismicity problem due to the strong geometric control on slab bending rates. Systematic differences in the style of slab seismicity, either side of the Pacific, may be largely explicable in terms of these geometric differences. The framework I develop for intermediate depth seismicity is consistent with the idea that slabs are largely supported by mantle drag and transmit relatively little in-plane stress.},

  abstract = {The relationship between intraslab seismicity and the dynamics of subduction is a subject of ongoing debate. Uncertainty surrounds (1) the extent to which the stress regime associated with slab earthquakes reflects the driving/resisting forces of subduction, or more localised processes such as metamorphic or thermo-elastic volume change, and (2) the relative contribution of uniform (stretching/shortening) and flexural (bending/buckling) deformation modes in slabs. Because variations in slab curvature are very clear in subduction zones with flat slab segments, such settings allow for assessment of the relationship between slab geometry, bending and seismicity. Using a numerical model that reproduces published flat slab geometries we show how bending rates, which are dominated by the advective component, relate to downdip curvature gradients. Based on published slab geometries, we show that the patterns of seismicity in the Peruvian and Mexican flat slabs, vary systematically with slab curvature gradient. Seismicity is restricted to regions colder than about 600\textdegree C. This means that only the upper half of flat slab bending zones are expressed seismically, providing the appearance of a uniform extensional regime.},

This approach is attractive in its simplicity, and can provide stable, asymmetric subduction systems that persist for many tens of millions of years. In this study we undertake a methodological analysis of the WL approach, and use these insights to guide improvements to the implementation. The issue that primarily motivates the study is the emergence of significant spatial and temporal thickness variations within the WL. We show that these variations are mainly the response to volumetric flux gradients, caused by the change in boundary conditions as the WL material enters and exits the zone of decoupling. The time taken to reach a quasi-equilibrium thickness profile will depend on the total plate convergence, and is around 7\&thinsp;Myr for the models presented here. During the transient stage, width variations along the WL can exceed 4\texttimes, which may impact the effective strength of the interface, through physical effects if the rheology is linear, or simply if the interface becomes inadequately numerically resolved. The transient stage also induces strong sensitivity to model resolution. By prescribing a variable-thickness WL at the outset of the model, and by controlling the limits of the layer thickness during the model evolution, we find improved stability and resolution convergence of the models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

These systems develop fine-scale, localized, weak shear band structures which are reminiscent of faults but it is a significant challenge to resolve the large- and the emergent, small-scale-behavior. We address this issue of resolution by taking into account the observation that a rock element with embedded, planar, failure surfaces responds as a non-linear, transversely isotropic material with a weak orientation defined by the plane of the failure surface. This approach partly accounts for the large-scale behavior of fine-scale systems of shear bands which we are not in a position to resolve explicitly. We evaluate the capacity of this continuum approach to model plate boundaries, specifically in the context of subduction models where the plate boundary interface has often been represented as a planar discontinuity. We show that the inclusion of the transversely isotropic plasticity model for the plate boundary promotes asymmetric subduction from initiation. A realistic evolution of the plate boundary interface and associated stresses is crucial to understanding inter-plate coupling, convergent margin driven topography, and earthquakes.},

  abstract = {Subduction is substantially multiscale process where the stresses are built by long-term tectonic motions, modified by sudden jerky deformations during earthquakes, and then restored by following multiple relaxation processes. Here we develop a cross-scale thermomechanical model aimed to simulate the subduction process from 1 min to million years' time scale. The model employs elasticity, nonlinear transient viscous rheology, and rate-and-state friction. It generates spontaneous earthquake sequences and by using an adaptive time step algorithm, recreates the deformation process as observed naturally during the seismic cycle and multiple seismic cycles. The model predicts that viscosity in the mantle wedge drops by more than three orders of magnitude during the great earthquake with a magnitude above 9. As a result, the surface velocities just an hour or day after the earthquake are controlled by viscoelastic relaxation in the several hundred km of mantle landward of the trench and not by the afterslip localized at the fault as is currently believed. Our model replicates centuries-long seismic cycles exhibited by the greatest earthquakes and is consistent with the postseismic surface displacements recorded after the Great Tohoku Earthquake. We demonstrate that there is no contradiction between extremely low mechanical coupling at the subduction megathrust in South Chile inferred from long-term geodynamic models and appearance of the largest earthquakes, like the Great Chile 1960 Earthquake.},

  abstract = {We have developed a 3-D spherical finite-element model to study the dynamic response to surface loads of a self-gravitating and incompressible Earth with 3-D viscoelastic structure. We have forced our model with the ICE-3G deglaciation history of Tushingham \& Peltier to study the effects of laterally varying lithospheric thickness on observations of post-glacial rebound (PGR). The laterally varying lithospheric thicknesses are derived from estimates of the thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere and from elastic thicknesses on continents as estimated from studies of long-term geological loads. Our calculations show that the effects of lithospheric structure on the relative sea level change (RSLC) depend on the locations of the observation sites and on the size of loads. The RSLC at the centre of the North American ice sheet is significantly less sensitive to lithospheric thickness, compared with the RSLC at the centre of the Fennoscandian ice sheet. At the peripheral bulges the RSLC tends to be more sensitive to lithospheric thickness. The RSLC is controlled by local lithospheric thickness. The RSLC at a given location, as predicted using models with laterally varying lithospheric thickness, can be reproduced using a 1-D model with a uniform lithospheric thickness equal to the local lithospheric thickness. Coupled with efficient parallel computing, we believe that the finite-element model that we present here can be used to address a variety of viscoelastic deformation problems in geodynamics.},
